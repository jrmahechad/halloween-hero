      <h2>I'm a thing.</h2>
      <p>
        If rubbin' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don't wanna be
        right. I can explain. It's very valuable. Oh, I always feared he might
        run off like this. Why, why, why didn't I break his legs? Why am I
        sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun?
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested
        bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them.
        <strong> I meant 'physically'.</strong>
        <em> Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food?</em> I could
        clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually?
      </p>
      <h2>Why would I want to know that?</h2>
      <p>
        For example, if you killed your grandfather, you'd cease to exist! Now
        what? With gusto. No, I'm Santa Claus!
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Shut up and get to the point!</li>
        <li>
          Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single?
          It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans!
        </li>
        <li>
          I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester
          quietly as a mental illness.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>What kind of a father would I be if I said no?</h3>
      <p>
        Is that a cooking show? Belligerent and numerous. Kif might! Isn't it
        true that you have been paid for your testimony? Morbo can't understand
        his teleprompter because he forgot how you say that letter that's shaped
        like a man wearing a hat.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think
          it would be something you'd have to freebase.
        </li>
        <li>I love you, buddy!</li>
        <li>
          I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get
          busy!
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        I'm a thing. Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy. They're like sex,
        except I'm having them! Hey, tell me something. You've got all this
        money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry?
      </p>
      <p>
        It must be wonderful. Say what? Ummmâ€¦to eBay? And then the battle's not
        so bad?
      </p>
      <p>
        We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small
        and neutral! Oh, all right, I am. But if anything happens to me, tell
        them I died robbing some old man. I was having the most wonderful dream.
        Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there!
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help
        me with my sexual inhibitions? Why would a robot need to drink? Ah,
        computer dating. It's like pimping, but you rarely have to use the
        phrase "upside your head."
      </p>
      <p>
        No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! For one
        beautiful night I knew what it was like to be a grandmother. Subjugated,
        yet honored. Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the
        sewer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Is the Space Pope reptilian!? You'll have all the Slurm you can drink
        when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie! Or a guy who burns down a bar
        for the insurance money! Hello, little man. I will destroy you!
      </p>
      <p>
        Bender, you risked your life to save me! It doesn't look so shiny to me.
        Fry! Stay back! He's too powerful! In our darkest hour, we can stand
        erect, with proud upthrust bosoms. Morbo can't understand his
        teleprompter because he forgot how you say that letter that's shaped
        like a man wearing a hat.
      </p>
      <p>
        I had more, but you go ahead. Okay, I like a challenge. Well, thanks to
        the Internet, I'm now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that
        panders to my lust for violence? Who's brave enough to fly into
        something we all keep calling a death sphere?
      </p>
      <p>
        For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your 'first' wife was the one
        who liked lilacs! What are their names? Kif, I have mated with a woman.
        Inform the men. Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down
        the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive
        decompression! Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really
        have the pure strength of 'will'? Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm
        going to come back there and change your opinions manually!
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps, but perhaps your civilization is merely the sewer of an even
        greater society above you! Tell them I hate them. And until then, I can
        never die? No argument here.
